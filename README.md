## 📚 Abstract

This research presents a comprehensive empirical study comparing four state-of-the-art approaches for reducing labeled data requirements in image classification: **Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL)**, **Active Learning (AL)**, **GAN-based Data Augmentation**, and **Supervised Baseline**. Through extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, we demonstrate that **different methods excel in different scenarios**: SSL achieves the highest data efficiency (50.43 accuracy points per 1000 labeled samples), while traditional supervised learning maintains the highest absolute accuracy (69.74%). Our findings provide practical guidance for selecting optimal learning strategies based on labeling budget and performance requirements.

**Key Contributions:**
- First comprehensive comparison of SSL, AL, and GAN augmentation in a unified experimental framework
- Empirical validation showing **SSL achieves 3.6× higher data efficiency** than supervised learning
- Discovery that **random sampling can outperform sophisticated AL strategies** in certain scenarios
- Open-source implementation enabling reproducible research in data-efficient learning

## 🎯 Motivation

In real-world machine learning applications, obtaining labeled data is often the primary bottleneck. While supervised learning with large datasets achieves excellent performance, many domains lack sufficient labeled examples. This research addresses the critical question: **"Which data-efficient learning method should practitioners choose given limited labeling budgets?"**

### Research Questions

1. **Performance Trade-offs**: How do SSL, AL, and GAN augmentation compare in terms of absolute accuracy vs. data efficiency?
2. **Convergence Behavior**: Which methods converge faster and more stably?
3. **Practical Applicability**: What are the computational and implementation costs of each approach?
4. **Scaling Properties**: How do methods perform across different data regime sizes?

## 🔬 Methodology

### Mathematical Foundations

#### Semi-Supervised Learning (FixMatch)
FixMatch combines consistency regularization with confidence-based pseudo-labeling:

```
L = L_s + λ_u * L_u
```

Where:
- **L_s** = `(1/|B|) * Σ H(p_b, p_m(y|α(A(x_b))))` (supervised loss)
- **L_u** = `(1/μ|B|) * Σ 𝟙(max(q_b) ≥ τ) * H(q̂_b, p_m(y|A(A(u_b))))` (unsupervised loss)

**Key Parameters:**
- Confidence threshold: τ = 0.95
- Unsupervised loss weight: λ_u = 1.0
- Weak augmentation: α(x) (crop + flip)
- Strong augmentation: A(x) (crop + flip + color jitter + affine)

#### Active Learning Query Strategies

**Entropy-based Uncertainty:**
```
H(p) = -Σ p_i * log(p_i)
```

**Margin-based Uncertainty:**
```
U_margin(x) = p_1(x) - p_2(x)
```

Where `p_1(x)` and `p_2(x)` are the top-2 prediction confidences.

**Least Confidence:**
```
U_LC(x) = 1 - max_i p_i(x)
```

#### GAN-based Data Augmentation

**DCGAN Objective:**
```
min_G max_D V(D,G) = E[x~p_data(x)][log D(x)] + E[z~p_z(z)][log(1-D(G(z)))]
```

**Conditional Generation:**
- **Generator**: `G(z, y) → x` (latent noise + class label → image)
- **Discriminator**: `D(x) → (validity, class)` (image → real/fake + class prediction)

### Experimental Setup

**Dataset:** CIFAR-10 (50K training, 10K test)
**Architecture:** ResNet-18 (modified for 32×32 resolution)
**Hardware:** NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support
**Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, F1-score, Data Efficiency, Training Time

**Data Splits:**
- **Baseline**: 5,000 labeled samples
- **SSL**: 900 labeled + 4,000 unlabeled samples  
- **Active Learning**: 500 initial → 900 final labeled samples
- **GAN Augmentation**: 5,000 original + 2,500/5,000 synthetic samples
